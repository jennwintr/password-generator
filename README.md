<p>With the help of a tutor, I was able to create a password generator that can meet certain criterias:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIVEN I need a new, secure password</li>
<li>WHEN I click the button to generate a password</li>
<li>THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria</li>
<li>WHEN prompted for password criteria</li>
<li>THEN I select which criteria to include in the password</li>
<li>WHEN prompted for the length of the password</li>
<li>THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters</li>
<li>WHEN asked for character types to include in the password</li>
<li>THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters</li>
<li>WHEN I answer each prompt</li>
<li>THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected</li>
<li>WHEN all prompts are answered</li>
<li>THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria</li>
<li>WHEN the password is generated</li>
<li>THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page</li>
</ul>
